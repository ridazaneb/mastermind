# Mastermind Game by S. Rida Zaneb

## How to Play

Mastermind is a code-breaking game where one player (the codebreaker) tries to guess the secret code chosen by the other player (the codemaker). The codebreaker has 5 attempts to guess the code.

1. The game generates a secret code.

2. The codebreaker's goal is to guess the secret code within 5 attempts and before the computer guesses it.

3. The codebreaker makes guesses by selecting a sequence of colored pegs. After each guess, the game provides feedback to help narrow down the possibilities.

4. The feedback consists of two numbers:
   - The number of correct colors in the guess that are not in the correct position.
   - The number of correct colors in the guess that are in the correct position.

5. The game ends when the codebreaker correctly guesses the secret code or when they run out of attempts or the computer guesses before you.

6. Please follow the instructions on the screen and insert your guesses out of [red, yellow, blue, green, purple, orange] separated by a space. 

Enjoy playing Mastermind!
